[Deploy this function on flows.network](#deploy-your-own-code-review-bot-in-3-simple-steps), and you will get a GitHub ðŸ¤– to review and summarize Pull Requests. It helps busy open source contributors understand and make decisions on PRs faster! A few examples below!

* [[Rust] Improve support for host functions in the WasmEdge Rust SDK](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/pull/2394#issuecomment-1497819842)
* [[bash] Support ARM architecture in the WasmEdge installer](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/pull/1084#issuecomment-1497830324)
* [[C++] Add an eBPF plugin for WasmEdge](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/pull/2314#issuecomment-1497861516)
* [[Haskell] Improve the CLI utility for WasmEdge Component Model tooling](https://github.com/second-state/witc/pull/73#issuecomment-1507539260)

> Still not convinced? [See "potential problems 1" in this review](https://github.com/second-state/wasmedge-quickjs/pull/82#issuecomment-1498299630), it identified an inefficient Rust implementation of an algorithm. ðŸ¤¯

This bot summarizes commits in the PR. Alternatively, you can use [this bot](https://github.com/flows-network/github-pr-review) to review changed files in the PR. 

## How it works

This flow function (or ðŸ¤–) will be triggered when a new PR is raised in the designated GitHub repo. The flow function collects the content in the PR, and asks ChatGPT/4 to review and summarize it. The result is then posted back to the PR as a comment. The flow functions are written in Rust and run in hosted [WasmEdge Runtimes](https://github.com/wasmedge) on [flows.network](https://flows.network/).

* The code review comment is updated automatically every time a new commit is pushed to this PR.
* A new code review could be triggered when someone says a magic *trigger phrase* in the PR's comments section. The default trigger phrase is "flows summarize".

## Deploy your own code review bot in 3 simple steps

1. Create a bot from a template
2. Configure the bot to review PRs on a specified GitHub repo
3. Authorize [flows.network](https://flows.network/) to access the GitHub repo

### 0 Prerequisites

You will need to bring your own [OpenAI API key](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api). If you do not already have one, [sign up here](https://platform.openai.com/signup).

You will also need to sign into [flows.network](https://flows.network/) from your GitHub account. It is free.

### 1 Create a bot from a template

[**Just click here**](https://flows.network/flow/createByTemplate/summarize-github-pull-requests)

### 2 Configure the bot

* `github_owner`: GitHub org for the repo *you want to deploy the ðŸ¤– on*.
* `github_repo` : GitHub repo *you want to deploy the ðŸ¤– on*.

> Let's see an example. You would like to deploy the bot to summarize PRs on `WasmEdge/wasmedge_hyper_demo` repo. Here `github_owner = WasmEdge` and `github_repo = wasmedge_hyper_demo`.

Click on the "Create and deploy" button.

## 3 Authorize access

After that, [flows.network](https://flows.network/) will direct you to configure the external services required by your flow function ðŸ¤–.

For this flow function, we need to configue two integrations.

Click on the "Connect" or "+ Add new authentication" button to add your OpenAI API key.

Click on the "Connect" or "+ Add new authentication" button to give the function access to the GitHub repo to deploy the ðŸ¤–. You'll be redirected to a new page where you must grant [flows.network](https://flows.network/) permission to the repo.

After that, click on the "Check" button to go to the flow details page. As soon as the flow's status became `running`, the PR summary GitHub bot is ready to give code reviews! The bot is summoned by every new PR, every new commit, as well as magic words (i.e., `trigger_phrase`) in PR comments.

## FAQ

### Customize the bot

The bot's source code is available in the GitHub repo you cloned from the template. Feel free to make changes to the source code (e.g., model, context length, API key and prompts) to fit your own needs. If you need help, [ask in Discord](https://discord.gg/ccZn9ZMfFf)!

### Use GPT4

By default, the bot uses GPT3.5 for code review. If your OpenAI API key has access to GPT4, you can open the `src/github-pr-review.rs` file
in your cloned source code repo, and change `GPT35Turbo` to `GPT4` in the source code. Commit and push the change back to GitHub.
The flows.network platform will automatically detect and rebuild the bot from your updated source code.

### Use the bot on multiple repos

You can create a new flow and import the source code repo for the bot (i.e., the repo you cloned from the template). Then, you can use the flow config to specify the `github_owner` and `github_repo` to point to the target repo you need to deploy the bot on. Deploy and authorize access to that target repo.

You can repeat this for all target repos you would like to deploy this bot on.

### Change the magic phrase

Go to the "Settings" tab of the running flow function for the bot, you can update the `trigger_phrase` config. The value of this config is the magic phrase the user will say to trigger a review from a PR comment.

This flow function is originally created by [Jay Chen](https://github.com/jaykchen), and [jinser](https://github.com/jetjinser) made significant contributions to optimize the event triggers from GitHub.
